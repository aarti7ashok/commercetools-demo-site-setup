  groupColumn:
    # in "col" put the name of the column that identifies product variants that belong together (e.g. a master product identifier etc. If such an attribute missing, the product name can be a demo-suitable "hack" value).
    col: "TODO FILL ME"
    type: "constant"
  columnMapping:
    -
      # start with just copying the columns over, that you need
      type: "copyFromOriginal"
      "includeCols":
        - "TODO"
        - "TODO2"
      # alternatively, comment out "includeCols" and just exclude certain columns (not recommended)
      # excludeCols:
      #   - "XXX"
    # Now add more specific transformations below instead of just copying.
    # Examples can be found in the file "csv-mapping-examples.yaml"
